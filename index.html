            <p>On this webpage, you will find informations about our nation :</p>

            <br>

            <p>The Federation of Kyrda was originally meant to be a fictional country based in Minecraft. The Supreme Leader of Kyrda, @jcansantwo, made the fictional country into ROBLOX. Since then, The Federation of Kyrda is a country based in ROBLOX and Minecraft. Our Capital City, "Mukhtar", is located in a Minecraft Server owned by @llama_ivre. </p>

            <p>The Original Flag of the Federation of Kyrda, or, The Banner of Kyrda, was made using the Minecraft banner crafting system. Since the country has turned its interests more to ROBLOX, Our flag has kept the same pattern, but the borders have been smoothed to remove the Minecraft aspect.</p>

            <p>The Philosophy of Kyrda is to promote world peace.</p>
